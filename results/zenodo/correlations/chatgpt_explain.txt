To evaluate the alignment between objective image quality metrics 
and human perception, we computed the Spearman rank correlation between 
per-image metric scores and the average expert ratings from the annotated 
Zenodo dataset. The analysis was performed separately for each of the 
three reconstruction methods (categories 0, 1, and 2), using 378 image pairs per category.

The results show that MSSSIM, IWSSIM, and HAARPSI consistently exhibit
strong positive correlations (r > 0.75 in category 2), indicating that 
these metrics closely follow expert judgments of image quality. SSIM
and VIF also demonstrate moderate to strong correlations, depending on 
the category. On the other hand, error-based metrics such as GMSD and
MSGMSD show strong negative correlations with expert scores, which is 
expected given their inverse formulation (lower metric = higher quality).

These findings suggest that certain full-reference metrics—particularly 
MSSSIM, IWSSIM, and HAARPSI—are reliable indicators of perceptual quality
in optoacoustic image reconstruction, and could be favored for future evaluations. 
Furthermore, the consistency of these results across different reconstruction 
categories supports the robustness of these metrics in varying configurations.
